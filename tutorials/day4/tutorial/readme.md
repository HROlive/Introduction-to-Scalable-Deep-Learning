Day 4 Tutorial 
==============

We have seen in day 3 that for various reasons, peformance can deteriorate when scaling
the batch size. In this tutorial, you will learn how to deal with performance deterioration
using different mechanisms that have been shown experimentally to help keeping
the same performance as the baseline training with one worker.
