2. Software on your local machine
What software is necessary for this course?

The course is platform-independent. It can even be followed by a Windows user, but if possible, avoid it. In general. Forever.

- Visual Studio Code: it's a free editor which we will demo on this course. Get it from https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Visual Studio Code Remote Development: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack
- Visual Studio: Remote - SSH: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh
- (WINDOWS ONLY): WSL. This installs the WSL support for Visual Studio Code, which will install WSL itself (And Ubuntu). https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl - This is a long install, take your time. You need administrator rights on your computer.
- A terminal. On Linux and Mac, it's just called "Terminal". Little familiarity with it is required. On windows, the WSL should install it.
- The `ssh` command. It's installed by default on Mac and Linux, and should be on Windows after the aforementioned steps.
- Some knowledge of the python language.
